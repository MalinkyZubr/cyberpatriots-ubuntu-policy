# JSerra Cyberpatriots Ubuntu Security Policy
### Goal
This project was made with the intention of improving team efficiency while executing basic system hardening tasks during cyberpatriots competitions to free up time to focus on more complex, unique problems. 

The program automates several workflows, including:
* system updates
* installation of security software
* firewall configuration
* removal of potentially harmful programs
* antivirus configuration and running

### Usage
To use the policy, run the policy scripts in the order of their names (P1 then P2). The scripts are separated because the system must be restarted after software installation. Respond to all text prompts and questions as they present themselves.

### Contributing
* All members of JSerra cyberpatriots please contribute, there is much more that can be done with this program!
