# JSerra Cyberpatriots Ubuntu Security Policy
### Goal
This project was made with the intention of improving team efficiency while executing basic system hardening tasks during cyberpatriots competitions to free up time to focus on more complex, unique problems. 

The program automates several workflows, including:
* system updates
* installation of security software
* firewall configuration
* removal of potentially harmful programs
* antivirus configuration and running

### Contributing
